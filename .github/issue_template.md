## Darklang Release X

- [ ] create and fill in a new set of release notes
  - [ ] create a new `release-n.md` page in `docs/changelog`
  - [ ] use [the `dark-changelog` canvas](https://darklang.com/a/dark-changelog)
        to fill in a draft of the changelog this gather PRs merged throughout
        the month
  - [ ] add reference to new page in sidebar
  - [ ] create headers; move bullets to appropriate headers
  - [ ] merge similar bullets where relevant
  - [ ] revise wording
  - [ ] review each item and fill in changelog with images, diagrams, screen
        recordings, etc.
- [ ] backfill docs with anything we've done in the past month (if there's not
      much, just edit it in the main PR; otherwise backfilling docs in separate
      PRs might make sense)
- [ ] publish changelog and docs updates
- [ ] write blog post
  - [ ] review each of the things we've done in the past month
  - [ ] consider
    - [ ] what were the major themes of the month?
    - [ ] what's immediately useful to our users?
    - [ ] what interesting technical challenges did we face?
  - [ ] can we link to any new docs/features?
  - [ ] what header image should we use?
- [ ] record (video/audio) a release review, and thoughts for he upcoming
      month(s)
- [ ] publish the recording to youtube (after minor editing?); update blog post
      with link
- [ ] draft email/tweet/toot
- [ ] publish blog post with missing/broken links at the bottom
- [ ] publish to mastodon, reddit, twitter, lobstrs, etc.
- [ ] update blog post with all of those links
- [ ] send email to users

It may be worth additionally considering:

- [ ] were there any emergencies (i.e. service interruptions) throughout the
      month? are they worth documenting within the changelog or during our
      normal release cycle? Check `#status` and `#operations` in Discord, for
      reference.
