We continuously deploy all features as they're written, but find it useful to
have "releases" that cover work released with a given period of time. At this
point, we 'release' on a monthly basis, which basically amounts to publishing a
changelog of work completed within the given month. We
[started this trend in June of 2022](https://blog.darklang.com/darklang-release-schedule).
Prior to that, release notes were published along various timelines.

- [Release 8](changelog/release-8.md) - December 1, 2022
- [Release 7](changelog/release-7.md) - November 1, 2022
- [Release 6](changelog/release-6.md) - October 1, 2022
- [Release 5](changelog/release-5.md) - September 1, 2022
- [Release 4](changelog/release-4.md) - August 1, 2022
- [Release 3](changelog/release-3.md) - July 1, 2022
- [Release 2](changelog/release-2.md) - June 6, 2022
- [Release 1](changelog/release-1.md) - everything before "Release 2"
